# LAN Connection Configuration

In this project, LAN (Local Area Network) connection configuration is performed using the Cisco Packet Tracer network simulation platform.

# The highlights of the project include:

- Network Topology Design: A network topology is designed that includes multiple interconnected LANs, representing a typical organization or enterprise environment.

- Network Device Configuration: Network devices, such as switches and routers, are configured to establish connectivity between LANs and facilitate data exchange between them.

- Network Segmentation: LANs are segmented into smaller subnets using static or dynamic routing to improve network performance and security.

- VLAN Configuration: VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) are implemented to logically segment the network and improve traffic management, security and performance.

- Network Protocol Configuration: Network protocols such as TCP/IP, DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and DNS (Domain Name System) are configured to facilitate communication and dynamic IP address assignment on the LAN.

- Connectivity Testing: Extensive connectivity tests are carried out between network devices on different LANs, verifying the communication capacity and the correct configuration of the network connection.

- Network Security: Security measures, such as access control lists (ACLs) and network authentication, are implemented to protect the LAN against threats and unauthorized access.

- Documentation and Evaluation: The LAN networking configuration process is documented in detail, along with the results obtained during the simulation. The effectiveness and efficiency of the LAN configuration is evaluated in terms of performance, security and availability.
